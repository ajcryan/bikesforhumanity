		<p>We recycle and buy bikes to provide to communities in need overseas</p>

<p>Our bikes change lives by increasing access to education, employment and health care through improved mobility and self-empowerment.</p>

<p>In Namibia shipping containers become pre-built bicycle workshops providing employment opportunities and empowering these communities to sustain their own fleet of bikes. We have assisted establishment of the Karasburg Bicycle Empowerment Centre in Southern Namibia and sent containers of bikes to restock existing workshops across Namibia.</p>

<p>Weâ€™d love you to donate bikes or funds, fundraise, or volunteer with us.</p>
