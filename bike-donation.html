		<p>Click <a href="#">here</a> to learn about the process of donation, how it happens and the way it changes lives.</p>
<p>At this site the next Bicycles for Humanity donation day will be 17 May. Get your bike donation there between 11am and 3pm to chat to us and donate your bike.</p>
<p><strong>No Kids or Racing bike donations thanks. We try to only send those bikes that are economically useful and fat tyre bikes work best with the sand and thorns in Africa. Thanks</strong></p>
<p>The address for Sydney drop off is The St Ives Showgrounds, Mova Vale Rd. Zoom in or out Using + or _ on the Google map below to for a more detailed or broader view.</p>

<p>At this site we've partnered with Kuringai Council who are generously providing space and much more. This is where we prepare, collect bikes and load them into our next shipping container ready for Africa.</p>
<p>Meet us at the container and we'll receive your (mountain) bike, prepare it and pack it, ready for shipping.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/donate-a-bike/which-bikes-are-best/">here to get an idea of which bikes are best for African conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Bikes for Humanity can transport your old bike to a Namibian community, establish a sustainable bike shop, and even train local staff. So while it may be worthless to you, that dusty two-wheeler could have a magnificent future improving access to health care, education and empowering people in Africa.</p>

<p>We're always looking for new spots to form bike collections so get in contact if you have ideas.</p>
<p>St Ives is our only collection point in Sydney at this stage.</p>
<p>If you live far away, or can't make it on the day, and you need to get rid of a perfectly good bike, consider giving to one of the other <a href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/donate-a-bike/other-organisations-who-recycle/">organisations</a> in the Sydney region who collect and recycle second hand bikes.</p>
