		<h1>Donate your Bike</h1>
		<p><a href="#">Read</a> about the process of donation, how it happens and the way it changes lives.</p>
<p>Find out <a href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/donate-a-bike/which-bikes-are-best/">which bikes are best</a> for African conditions.</p>
<p><strong>No Kids or Racing bike donations thanks. We try to only send those bikes that are economically useful and fat tyre bikes work best with the sand and thorns in Africa. Thanks</strong></p>
<p>St Ives is our only collection point in Sydney at this stage.  We also have collection points in the <a href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/donate-a-bike/southern-highlands-collections/" target="_blank">Southern Highlands</a>, or <a href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/donate-a-bike/canberra-bike-collection/" target="_blank">Canberra</a>, or the <a href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/donate-a-bike/blue-mountains-collection/">Blue Mountains</a>.</p>
<p>We're always looking for new spots to form bike collections so <a href="#">get in contact</a> if you have ideas.</p>
<p>If you live far away, or can't make it on the day, and you need to get rid of a perfectly good bike, consider giving to one of the <a href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/donate-a-bike/other-organisations-who-recycle/">other organisations</a> in the Sydney region who collect and recycle second hand bikes.</p>
<p>The Sydney drop off is at The St Ives Showgrounds, Mova Vale Rd.</p>
<p>The next donation day here will be 17 May. Please come along between 11am and 3pm to donate your bike.</p>

<p>We have partnered with Ku-ring-gai Council who have generously provided space and assistance. This is where we prepare, collect bikes and load them into our next shipping container ready for Africa.</p>
