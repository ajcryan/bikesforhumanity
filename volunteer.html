<p>Cash donations are essential to help get the bikes to Namibia, administer Bikes for Humanity Sydney, sustain more Bicycle Empowerment Centers, train staff and start the process of empowering communities across Namibia. Each bike costs about $35 to send.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.givenow.com.au/bikesforhumanity" target="_blank">here</a> to be taken to our secure online donation facility (via Westpac's Give Now).</p>
<p>The bikes change lives forever by improving basic mobility for access to health care and education, and increasing economic productivity. The shipping container becomes a pre-built bicycle workshop providing further employment opportunities.</p>
<p>If you are looking to participate in a charity event like the City2Surf, or Sydney Running Festival we would be honoured if you would consider donating the results of your efforts to our cause.  Click <a href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/get-involved/be-a-hero/">here</a> to find out how to make your run contribute directly to improving peoples' lives in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong> all donations are <strong>not</strong> tax deductible. We are currently working toward Deductible Gift Register status with the Australian Tax Office. However, we are a registered fundraising charity with the NSW department of Fair Trading and an incorporated association registered in NSW, Australia as Bicycles for Humanity, Sydney (INC9892018).</p>
