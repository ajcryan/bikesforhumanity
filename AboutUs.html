		<h2>What is Bikes for Humanity?</h2>
Communities in need can be empowered if they have easy access to affordable and quality transport such as a bicycle. Having a bike cuts down time getting to employment, education and health care. Bicycles are a powerful, sustainable, simple, and appropriate technology to support people in these communities to improve their own livelihood.

Founded in 2009 with the support of many <a title="Who are our active supporters?" href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/?page_id=124" target="_blank">volunteers</a> and <a href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/partners/">partners</a>, Bikes for Humanity Sydney is part of a <a title="The global bikes for development network" href="http://www.bikesforhumanity.com.au/?page_id=318" target="_blank">global network</a>.

Our <strong>purpose</strong> is to recycle and buy bikes to provide to communities in need overseas.

Our <strong>objectives</strong> for the next two years are:
<ul>
	<li>develop efficient systems for collection and delivery of used bikes</li>
	<li>encourage people to donate, fundraise or volunteer for our projects</li>
	<li>raise funds to send and buy bikes</li>
	<li>assess, monitor and evaluate in-country project delivery and partners</li>
	<li>maintain strong governance systems and effective operations</li>
</ul>

</ul>
An estimated <a title="www.cyclingpromotion.com.au" href="http://www.cyclingpromotion.com.au/content/view/381/150/" target="_blank">1.2 million bikes</a> are sold in Australia every year. This means there is a large untapped resource of second bikes waiting for a new life. Our aim is to collect the best of these bikes along with a donation to send them to reliable partner organisations overseas.
<h2>Do bikes make a difference?</h2>
Compared to walking, bikes give people a big jump in productivity. They save a lot of time and energy moving people and stuff around.

Here are some examples of the amazing power of bikes:
<ul>
	<li>Bicycles increase carrying capacity, five times as much as compared to walking.</li>
	<li>Bicycles increase the distance a person can travel by four times compared to walking.</li>
	<li>Bicycles save time; approximately three hours for every ten miles traveled compared to walking.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">Bikes for Humanity Sydney is part of <a href="http://www.bicycles-for-humanity.org/"><em>Bicycles for Humanity International</em></a> and the <a href="http://www.benbikes.org.za/namibia/"><em>Bicycling Empowerment Network</em></a> is our major partner distributing bikes in Africa.</p>

<h2>What does our in-country partner do?</h2>
In Karasburg our in-country partner - the <a title="BEN Namibia" href="http://benbikes.org.za/namibia/" target="_blank">Bicycling Empowerment Network (BEN)</a> is about to refurbish our shipping container into a ‘Bicycle Empowerment Centre’. The container becomes a pre-fabricated bike workshop providing skills training, employment and business opportunities to the community.

Our Namibian partner has provided over 36 centers that have distributied bicycles for the transport of medical staff and equipment, and to assist people to get from A to B when they otherwise would have walked. Rather than sitting in the garage your old bike could remove the tyranny of distance for HIV nurses and educators. Find out more about how to <a href="../?page_id=116">donate your bike</a> and get it to Africa.
