We're raising funds to send our next container load of bikes to the Namibia. Each bike costs about $35 to send.

So cash donations are essential to help get the bikes to Namibia, administer Bikes for Humanity Sydney, sustain more Bicycle Empowerment Centers, train staff and start the process of empowering communities across Namibia.
<h2><strong><strong><a href="http://www.givenow.com.au/bikesforhumanity" target="_blank">GiveNow</a> is our secure online donation facility</strong></strong></h2>
Please consider donating funds directly to our projects through the commission-free online donations service <a href="http://www.givenow.com.au/bikesforhumanity">GiveNow</a>.

Funds raised will be used to pay for shipping and clearance costs of sending bikes to Africa, ground transport in Australia and Africa, bike collections, containers and organisational administration.

The bikes change lives forever by improving basic mobility for access to health care and education, and increasing economic productivity. The shipping container becomes a pre-built bicycle workshop providing further employment opportunities.
