<p>Cash donations are essential to help get the bikes to Namibia, administer Bikes for Humanity Sydney, sustain more Bicycle Empowerment Centers, train staff and start the process of empowering communities across Namibia. Each bike costs about $35 to send.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.givenow.com.au/bikesforhumanity" target="_blank">here</a> to be taken to our secure online donation facility (via Westpac's Give Now).</p>
<p>Please consider donating funds directly to our projects through the commission-free online donations service <a href="http://www.givenow.com.au/bikesforhumanity">GiveNow</a>.</p>

<p>Funds raised will be used to pay for shipping and clearance costs of sending bikes to Africa, ground transport in Australia and Africa, bike collections, containers and organisational administration.</p>

<p>The bikes change lives forever by improving basic mobility for access to health care and education, and increasing economic productivity. The shipping container becomes a pre-built bicycle workshop providing further employment opportunities.</p>

<p>You can donate through our secure online <a href="http://www.givenow.com.au/bikesforhumanity" target="_blank">GiveNow</a> facility. GiveNow is powered by Westpac and administered by <a href="http://www.ourcommunity.com.au/" target="_blank">OurCommunity</a>.</p>
